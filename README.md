# Scrapy-LABuildingInfo
This script uses selenium package to grab LA building information from zimas.lacity.org.
Use building parcel number to look for the building information. Alternatively, you can use address or other information to search. However, specific input format for address is required by the website. 
This script can be used as a general framework for scrapy. 
No input information will be provide. 

Thanks to my roommate Tengyu Liu's help.
